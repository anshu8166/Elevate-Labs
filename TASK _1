**Netflix Movies and TV Shows** dataset as part of the MSME Data Analyst Internship The goal was to transform "messy" raw data into a structured format ready for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting. 
## Tools Used
* **Primary Tool:** Microsoft Excel ] 
* **Techniques:** Filter & Sort, Conditional Formatting, Text Functions (TRIM, PROPER, UPPER) , POWER PIVOT
## Data Cleaning
Steps I followed a professional pipeline to ensure data integrity: 
1. **Data Preservation:** Created a backup tab and saved the original file as `Raw_Data.xlsx` before any modifications.
2. **Missing Value Management:** - Used **Filter → Blank values
** to identify missing data in columns like `director` and `cast` - Highlighted blanks using 
**Conditional Formatting** - Replaced missing values with "Unknown" to preserve the records for other analytical purposes 
3. **Deduplication:** Utilized the **Remove Duplicates** feature on the `show_id` column to ensure unique records. - 
4. **Format Validation:** Standardized the `date_added` column to a consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD) and ensured numeric columns contained no symbols 
5 **Documentation:** Added a `Data_Quality_Notes` column to track all modifications (e.g., "missing director names present")
